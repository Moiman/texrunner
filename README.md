texrunner
=========

texrunner provides a (hopefully) convenient interface to TeX including functions for running TeX, parsing log files.

The online module allows retrieving results of commands, such as dimensions of an `hbox`, using TeX's interactive features.

This module is new and likely contains lots of bugs.
