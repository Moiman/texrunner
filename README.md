texrunner
=========

texrunner provides a (hopefully) convenient interface to Tex including
functions for running Tex, parsing log files.

The online module allows retrieving results of commands, such as
dimensions of an `hbox`, using Tex's interactive features.

This package is a work in progress and likely contains lots of bugs.
Eventually I hope it will be good enough for general use but for now
it's only suitable for simple things.
